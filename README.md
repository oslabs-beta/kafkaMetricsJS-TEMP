# **KafkaJSMetrics**

A lightweight KafkaJS library that provides simple access to key metrics within your code. KafkaJSMetrics enables custom breakpoint alerts and logging of key metrics, allowing for client health to be monitored within applications. The optional visualizer feature introduces a real-time, web browser display of the metrics associated with your KafkaJS client.
